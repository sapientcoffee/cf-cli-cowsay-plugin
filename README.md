# CF CLI Cowsay
This is a fun learning exercise to teach me how to create a cf cli and also help teach me go.

I am sure that this could be written in a more efficient way however for the purpose of learning it is what it is. My goal was to have a working `cf cli` plugin by writing my 1st golang progam that is testable (new concept as well).

### Still to do
